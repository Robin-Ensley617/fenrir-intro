            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am hard-working and curious. Constantly seeking new opportunities to gain lasting experiences in the medical field and software development. With the ability to quickly learn new concepts and problem solve, I thrive in new environments.
            Currently, I attend El Camino College to earn my A.A in Nursing after discovering my love for educating and caring for those around me. Between school and working full time, you can always find me either reading a book, indulging in tv documentaries, or making art.

            <p>I am a beginner learner in the process of becoming familiar with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Git.
             In the meantime, I work as a nurse assistant at a rehab facility in Los Angeles.
